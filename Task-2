# 🌐 Responsive Planner Web App – Internship Task 2

This project is part of my internship at **ApexPlanet**, where I was tasked with building a responsive, multi-functional web page using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Dynamic **To-Do List** with date & time support
- 🌓 **Dark Mode** toggle
- 📸 **Image Gallery** to add images by URL
- 📱 **Fully responsive** layout for all screen sizes
- 🧠 Task filtering – View All, Active, and Completed
- 🗑️ Option to clear completed tasks

All functionality is powered by vanilla JavaScript — no external frameworks used.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
3. Start adding tasks and explore the planner features!

## 📚 What I Learned

- DOM manipulation with JavaScript  
- Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox  
- Implementing dark mode toggles  
- Structuring a multipage-like single-page UI
